“The dreamer—if you want an exact definition—is not a human being,
but a creature of an intermediate sort.
For the most part he settles in some inaccessible corner,
as though hiding from the light of day; once he slips into his corner,

he grows to it like a snail, or, anyway,
he is in that respect very much like that remarkable creature,
which is an animal and a house both at once, and is called a tortoise.”
